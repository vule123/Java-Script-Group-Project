Bowling game!

Use A and D keys to move the ball left/right, and press space bar to send your ball! When your ball reaches the pins, you can press space bar to start a new attempt. You have 2 attempts to hit all the ten pins and win the game.

Note that the lane is a bit slope, so your ball will not go in straight line -- take care for gutters!

Advanced topic finished:
1. Collision detection among ball and pins,
2. Waxed wooden floor that reflect objects
